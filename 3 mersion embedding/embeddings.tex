\section{Embeddings}
\subsection{Topological Embeddings}
An injective contniuous map that is a homeomorphism onto its image (in the subspace topology) is called a \textbf{topological embedding}. If $f:A \to X$ is such a map, we can think of $f(A)$ as a homeomorphic copy of $A$ inside $X$. 

\begin{exercise}
    Let $X$ be a topological space and let $S$ be a subspace of $X$. Show that the inclusion $\iota:S \to X$ is a topological embedding. 
\end{exercise}

\begin{proposition}
    A continuous injective map that is either open or closed is a topological embedding.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
    A surjective topological embeddings is a homeomorphism. 
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Smooth Embeddings}
A smooth map $F:M \to N$ is called a \textbf{smooth embedding} if 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $F$ is an immersion, 
    \item $F$ is a topological embedding: $M$ is homeomorphic to $F(M) \subset N$ in the subspace topology.  
\end{enumerate}
